# Mobile App

This folder contains the React Native app built with **Expo**. It connects to Supabase and receives realtime updates for tasks.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the Expo dev server:

```bash
expo start
```

The app expects the Supabase URL and anon key to be provided via the Expo config in `app.json` or `app.config.js`.
